Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design

These are the code examples that go with Richard 
Bird's [Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design](http://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_1_25XK).

All the examples are working Haskell programs. For each I've included 
some short notes of my own on any issues in getting them to work.
